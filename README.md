TagReader for RaceResult HubTags ... To oranize and manage your HubTags after a race day for your RaceResult Dekoder 4000/5000/5000s

I have no information about the licenze for the TagReader.dll from RaceResult. If you want to scan Tags with the TagReader you have to ask RaceResult for the EasyPOD.dll and TagReader.dll they will offer it to you. If you only want to have a look you don't need it. Start the programm and explore the example.

The main platform for RaceResult is Windows 10. Such as this reader. The TagReader.dll is only available as a 32bit Windows library.

To compile the source you need QT 5.14. with the gcc compiler.
